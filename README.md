# DepositOnce - TU Berlin's repository

Here is explained how the API of TUB's DepositOnce works as well as some facts about the content of the repository.

## OAI-PMH

From the [official website](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/): The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers are repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. Service Providers then make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata. OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs or services that are invoked within HTTP.

Here is a cheat sheet with the possible queries, created by Richard Urban.
